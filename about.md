This blog is created by [Benjamin Kaiser](https://benkaiser.dev/about/). I am a Christian, a husband, a father, and a software engineer. I created this blog to experiment with AI generated devotionals for many different topics. I hope to encourage others in their faith and help them grow in their understanding of God's Word.

To reach out to me, please send me an email at devotional@benkasier.dev.
